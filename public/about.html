                Until recently, and in line with the majority of people, I was not able to answer yes to this question. Luckily for me, I have experienced early successes in my career that allow me to focus my time and energy obtaining a position in life to change my answer. Because of this, I have decided to move my career and devote my energy to my true passion for technology, specifically developing or improving cutting edge tech. <br><br>
                
                I have expert knowledge of business growth and development across multiple industries. The integrated use of both the Analytical data-driven side of my brain and my creative and humanistic side, allow me to enhance the lives of both my external and internal communities. I am a data-driven decision maker who excels in the ambiguity and strict deadline culture in the forefront of business. My entrepreneurial background allows me to effectively work in a cross-functional position to add value across divisions, as well as to motivate and manage multiple teams and projects. I am a strong believer that you can learn something new from everyone you meet; this allows me to effectively integrate into existing teams and to absorb everything that is offered. <br><br>
                
                I am looking for new and exciting opportunities, especially those that offer partial remote possibilities in the future, that allow me to expand my skills and knowledge in the technology field. I hope to be part of projects that expand on or create technology to advance the field. <br><br>
                
                Technical Experience: Git, GitHub, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Node.js, Agile, Heroku, Python, C++, Java, Google Analytics, Google AdWords, Adobe Photoshop, Bootstrap, Cypress, Express, Angular, SQL, PostgreSQL, API, Moca, React, Vue.js, AWS, MongoDB, Knex, jQuery, AJAX, JSON, Ember, Firebase, Postman, Sketch, Redux. <br><br>
